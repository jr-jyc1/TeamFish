# TeamFish - A 2v2 Chess Analysis Engine

This project is an implementation of a chess engine designed for 2v2 team-based chess, as described in the project proposal.

## Project Overview

TeamFish is a C++ application that aims to solve the unique challenges of 4-player chess, including:

-   **Team-Based Evaluation:** The engine will evaluate the board state from the perspective of a team, not an individual player.
-   **Multi-Agent Search:** It will use a search algorithm suitable for a multi-agent environment, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).
-   **Custom Game Logic:** The engine will implement the rules of 2v2 chess, including turn order, piece ownership, and win conditions.

This is a work in progress. The initial focus is on building the core game logic and a simple command-line interface. The AI components will be developed in later stages.
